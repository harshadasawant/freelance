            JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language. Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in JAVA. It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

            Main Features of JAVA:

            Java is a platform independent language Compiler(javac) converts source code (.java file) to the byte code (.class file). As mentioned above, JVM executes the bytecode produced by compiler. This byte code can run on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. Which means a program that is compiled on windows can run on Linux and vice-versa. Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems. That is why we call java as platform independent language.

            Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language:

            Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.

            4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:

            Abstraction
            Encapsulation
            Inheritance
            Polymorphism
            Simple

            Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features like Operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.
